# FACTORY AUTOMATION (STM32)

This is a factory automation project which made for use in STM32 Microcontroller.

## How to test the program?

Download all the files and load the program into STM32 Microcontroller with CUBE MX.

### Prerequisites

If you don't have any CUBE MX, you can download [CUBE MX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html).

## Running the tests

For testing this project you should set up an electrical circuit.

## Built With

* [C]() - Used to code all things.
* [CUBE MX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) - Used to load the project in STM32 Microcontroller.
